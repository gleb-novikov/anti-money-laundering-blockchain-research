# Introduction

AML (Anti-Money Laundering) is a system of measures and regulations aimed at combating money laundering. The purpose of AML is to prevent the legalization of proceeds gained through criminal activities by establishing requirements for financial institutions and businesses. These rules oblige organizations to identify clients, monitor suspicious transactions, and report them to the relevant authorities. In the cryptocurrency sphere, AML measures help reduce the risks of illegal uses of cryptocurrencies, such as terrorism financing, drug trafficking, and other criminal activities.

# AML Methods

1. **KYC (Know Your Customer)** â€“ identification and verification of customer identity to establish reliability.
2. **Transaction Monitoring** â€“ tracking client activities to detect unusual or suspicious operations.
3. **Customer Risk Analysis** â€“ assessing each clientâ€™s profile based on their activity, sources of funds, and transaction history.
4. **Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR)** â€“ requiring financial institutions to report suspicious transactions to regulatory authorities.

# AML Cases

## PlusToken Ponzi Scheme

In 2019, PlusToken raised approximately $2.9 billion by promising investors high returns through cryptocurrency arbitrage operations. However, it turned out to be a fraudulent scheme, where new participantsâ€™ funds were used to pay returns to earlier investors. The organizers cashed out significant amounts, leading to a sharp drop in Bitcoin prices. AML violations included the lack of proper customer verification (KYC) and neglect of transaction monitoring obligations.

## KuCoin Hacking

In September 2020, hackers infiltrated the KuCoin cryptocurrency exchange, stealing assets worth approximately $150 million. The exchange managed to recover 84% of the stolen funds thanks to cooperation with other platforms and projects. This incident underscored the need for enhanced security measures and adherence to AML procedures to prevent laundering of stolen assets.

## Thodex Scandal

In 2021, the CEO of Turkish cryptocurrency exchange Thodex disappeared with $2 billion belonging to 391,000 investors. Users lost access to their funds, which sparked widespread protests. AML violations included a lack of transparency, insufficient transaction monitoring, and non-compliance with KYC procedures.

## Silk Road

The underground marketplace Silk Road operated on the darknet and used Bitcoin for trading illegal goods, including drugs. Ross Ulbricht, the platformâ€™s creator, was arrested and convicted for money laundering and other crimes. The platform violated AML requirements by allowing anonymous transactions and failing to conduct user verification.

## BitMEX

In 2020, the cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX faced accusations of failing to comply with AML requirements. Regulators alleged that the platform did not implement adequate KYC procedures and failed to report suspicious transactions, which could facilitate money laundering. As a result, the exchange enhanced its AML policies and agreed to a settlement with authorities.

# Summary by LLM ðŸ¤–

AML (Anti-Money Laundering) measures in cryptocurrency aim to prevent the misuse of digital assets for illegal activities by enforcing identity verification, transaction monitoring, and risk assessment. Key cases like PlusTokenâ€™s Ponzi scheme, the KuCoin hack, and Thodexâ€™s exit scam reveal the risks of weak AML practices, often resulting in major financial losses and regulatory scrutiny. Strengthening AML compliance, as seen in BitMEX and Silk Road cases, is essential to uphold transparency and security in the crypto sector.
